## Hi there, my name is Sam 👋

I am a Software Devleoper based just outside of London. I am currently completing my MSc Computer Science at the University of Sussex.

### 🛠️ My Skillset
  - Languages: `JavaScript`, `Python`, a bit of `C`
  - Front-End: `React`, `Svelte`, `SvelteKit`, `Axios`
  - Back-End: `Express`, `Flask`, `PSQL`, `Firebase`, `RESTful APIs`
  - Testing: `Jest`, `Pytest`
  - Soft Skills: `Paired Programming`, `SCRUM`, `Agile`

### 🔭 I’m currently working on
  - Completing my MSc!

### ⚡ Fun facts
  - I love learning foreign languages! I am currently slowly bridging my way into fluency with Korean whilst starting out with Spanish.
  - My first coding project was called 'AQADo', a turn based counter game created for a GCSE back in 2015.

### 🌱 What I would like to learn in the future
  - I find embedded systems really interesting. I would love to begin that learning journey sometime in the future.
  - I love back-end, but I would also love to be able to create amazing front-end UI's. So improving my CSS skills is on my list.
  - At some point I would like to test the waters of game development. I've been a gamer since I was 10 so it only seems natural!
