### Hi there, my name is Sam 👋

I am a Software Devleoper based just outside of London. I am currently focusing on honing my JavaScript skills
but I love learning new languages, frameworks, and technologies to work on all sorts of different projects.

## 🛠️ My Skillset
  - Languages: `JavaScript`, `Python`, a bit of `C`
  - Front-End: `React`, `Svelte`, `SvelteKit`, `Axios`
  - Back-End: `Express`, `Flash`, `PSQL`, `Firebase`, `RESTful APIs`
  - Testing: `Jest`, `Pytest`
